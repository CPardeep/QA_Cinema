        <p>This website was created by members of team Earth. At team Earth we value effective devops methods to ensure the content that we create is
        suited for our users needs with a specific focus on what it is exactly that they want to be able to do first and then
        worrying the implementation afterwards. Because of this we utilise agile methods and use the scrum process to ensure the team
        is focusing on the right tasks and understand what their future gaols are all with the customer in mind. So what is scrum?</p>
        <br>
        <h2>The process</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Scrum is a framework that allows development teams to have a certain freedom and flexibility especially as
            situations change. It was developed so that developers could focus on solving the specific problems in a user story form with
            a sense of independence as after all they are the ones with the technical know how. Their tasks are put into user stories with the customer
            being the main focus of the task. These user stories are time-boxed iterations that can be collated and added to what are called sprints.
            These sprints can consist of multiple user stories that can relate to each other and all have associated times that estimate their predicted finish time.
            A key player in this process is the scrum master. It is their role to oversee the creation and completion of user stories keeping in mind
            the customers wants and needs. It is also their job to motivate and energise the team conducting stand-up meetings in the morning to ensure everybody knows what their
            aim is and see if there is anything blocking this process. The scrum master reports to the product owner who has the needs of the customers in mind and ensures that his vision
            of what the customer wants is being correctly realised. They are also responsible for organizing the user story backlog as they are the most in touch with what needs to be done
            and what does not for the time being. For more information click here: <a href="www.scrum.org" target="_blank">Scrum.org</a></p>
